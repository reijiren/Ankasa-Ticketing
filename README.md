<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Ankasa Ticketing is an application that allows users to find and order airline tickets. Ankasa Ticketing application will give all information about any airline available and any facilities that is provided. Users are able to find flight detail and book the flight. The application will calculate whether the user's balance is enough or not to complete the booking payment. If the user's balance is not enough, the booking status will be unpaid and user will need to complete the payment later. Users are able to edit their profile status in the profile page.
